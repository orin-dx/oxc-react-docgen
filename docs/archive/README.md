Historical record, not documentation. Nothing here reflects current state —
check `docs/STATUS.md` and `docs/rdt-coverage.md` for that instead.

- `00-MASTER-PLAN.md` through `07-AGENT-DISPATCH.md` — the original agent work
  orders used to bootstrap this repo (Phases 0-5b). All complete.
- `08-OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` — pre-implementation design questions. Resolved.
- `10-QUALITY-AND-ARCHITECTURE.md` — the resolver/extractor module-split
  refactor plan. Done; see `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the resulting layout.
- `10-PLUGIN-SPEC.md` — the Vite plugin spec. Shipped; see README.md.
- `adversarial-analysis-2026-06-28.md` — a point-in-time validation pass.
  Findings folded into `docs/rdt-coverage.md`.
- `2026-06-16-phase-5a-vite-plugin.md` — the Vite plugin implementation plan
  (follows on from `10-PLUGIN-SPEC.md`). Shipped; see `packages/vite-plugin`.
- `2026-06-25-phase6-integration-tests.md` — wiring `moon run validate:compare`
  for `apps/validate`. Shipped; see `docs/rdt-coverage.md` for how it's used.
- `2026-06-28-structural-gap-fixes.md` — five resolver gaps found during RDT
  compatibility auditing (method-sig params, React namespace types, `Readonly`,
  inline `Pick`/`Omit`). All fixed.
- `2026-07-07-adversarial-analysis-fixes.md` — an eight-task wave from a
  five-domain (perf/Rust-best-practices/security/UX-DX/output-correctness)
  adversarial analysis. All eight landed. Two items it explicitly deferred
  (scoped-key allocation caching, `cache.rs` dirty-flag/size-cap) are folded
  into `docs/STATUS.md`'s "What's not built yet" section so they aren't lost.
