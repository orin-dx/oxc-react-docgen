# Architecture Decision Records

Short, dated records of _architectural_ decisions — ones that shape system structure, boundaries, or contracts other code depends on. Not a changelog, not a design doc, not a place to explain what the code does — comments and `ARCHITECTURE.md` already do that.

## When to write one

Two gates, both required:

1. **Architectural.** It affects one of: system structure (module/crate boundaries, how components interact), a dependency or technology choice that ripples across the codebase, a data format or contract other code depends on, or a cross-cutting constraint (performance model, correctness discipline, security model).
2. **Expensive to reverse and not obvious from the code.** If it gets reverted in a year, what breaks, and would anyone know why?

If either answer is no, it's not an ADR.

Good candidates:

- Choosing OXC over the TypeScript compiler — a technology choice that shapes the whole extraction pipeline
- A serialization format with a hidden constraint (msgpack's positional encoding) — a data contract other code depends on
- Dropping a dependency, or an approach that was tried and abandoned

Not ADR material:

- A single function's algorithm choice, confined to that function — that's a code comment
- A bug fix — commit message, and if it's the kind of thing that could recur, a line in `rdt-coverage.md`
- A behavior-preserving refactor — commit message is enough
- A naming or style convention — that's `CLAUDE.md` or a lint rule
- Anything already obvious from the code or from `CLAUDE.md`'s non-negotiables

## Format

One file per decision: `docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered sequentially, never reused. Copy `0000-template.md` to start.

- **Never edit history.** If a decision changes, write a new ADR and mark the old one's status `Superseded by 000X`. Don't rewrite the old file to look like you knew all along.
- **Status** is one of: `Accepted`, `Superseded by NNNN`, `Deprecated`.
- Keep it short. If the technical depth doesn't fit on a screen, split it into its own doc and link it — see `0004-defer-type-checker-integration.md` pointing at `type-checker-integration.md` instead of inlining it.

## Writing it

Write like you're explaining it to the next engineer over their shoulder, not presenting it to a committee. Don't hard-wrap paragraphs at a fixed column — one line per paragraph, let the editor soft-wrap. Every other doc in this repo already does this; hard-wrapping just makes future diffs noisy when a sentence gets edited.

**Cut the filler.** If a sentence still means the same thing without a word, delete the word.

| Instead of | Write |
| --- | --- |
| "It's worth noting that this decision was made in order to leverage OXC's robust parsing capabilities" | "OXC parses in parallel with no type-checking pass" |
| "This represents a significant improvement in performance" | "32ms instead of several seconds" |
| "We decided to essentially utilize a positional encoding approach" | "We use positional encoding" |
| "In conclusion, this architecture provides a solid foundation going forward" | (delete — you already said the thing) |

**Banned by default:** _leverage, utilize, robust, seamless, cutting-edge, essentially, basically, in order to, it's worth noting, it is important to note, at the end of the day._ If one is genuinely the precise technical word for something, fine — but check first.

**Concrete beats vague.** Name the file, the number, the benchmark. "Slow" is not a fact; "several seconds on a mid-size design system" is.

**Active voice, plain structure.** "We chose X because Y" beats "X was chosen due to Y considerations." Sentence-case headers, not Title Case.

**Show the trade-off, not just the win.** A decision with no downside isn't a decision, it's a fact. Say what it costs.

## What good looks like

Read `0002-manual-serialize-for-prop-type.md` — a real bug behind it, a real number (`recursion_limit = 2048`), a real consequence, four sections, no throat-clearing.
