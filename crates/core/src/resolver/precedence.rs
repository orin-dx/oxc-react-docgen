//! Shared "try the project's own source before falling back to known
//! library-pattern shortcuts" resolution order.
//!
//! `named.rs` documented this order as intentional (source-defined types
//! like `ThemingProps`/`StylesApiProps` must never be silently replaced by
//! an opaque known-pattern shortcut). `chain.rs`'s `extends`-clause path
//! independently reimplemented the same sequence and got it backwards —
//! checking known patterns first. This is now the *only* place either call
//! site may implement that order, so they can't drift apart again.
