# Migrating from react-docgen-typescript

`oxc-react-docgen` targets output-shape compatibility with `react-docgen-typescript` (RDT) via the CLI's `--format rdt` flag. The NAPI binding and Vite plugin currently only expose this tool's own canonical format (`kind`-tagged `PropType`, shown in the main README) — no RDT-shape option at that layer yet.

This document covers what's compatible today, what's intentionally different, and what's a known gap rather than a design choice.

## Should you switch today?

Output should match closely if your components use:

- Plain interfaces or type aliases
- `forwardRef` (including wrapped in an `as` cast), `FC`, or HOC wrapping
- `Omit` / `Pick`
- `VariantProps` (CVA / TV / PandaCSS)
- Discriminated unions (including ones wrapped in an intersection)

Scraping the full 250+ inherited HTML attributes per component? It's supported, but opt-in — see [HTML attribute inheritance](#html-attribute-inheritance) below.

## Field-by-field comparison

### Component level (`ComponentDoc`)

| RDT field | `--format rdt` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `displayName` | ✅ |  |
| `description` | ✅ | From the component's own leading JSDoc, if any |
| `props` | ✅ | See prop-level table below |
| `methods` | ✅ (always `[]`) | RDT only populates this for class components; we don't support class components, so it's always empty — present for shape compatibility, not because we detect methods |
| `tags` | ✅ | JSDoc `@tag` values on the component declaration (e.g. `@deprecated`, `@since`) — not part of RDT's original spec but included since some tooling reads it |

### Prop level (`PropItem`)

| RDT field | `--format rdt` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | ✅ |  |
| `required` | ✅ |  |
| `type.name` | ✅ | Literal unions emit `{name: "enum", value: [...]}` matching RDT's convention (so Storybook-style `<select>` controls activate) instead of inlining the literal text |
| `description` | ✅ |  |
| `defaultValue` | ✅ | `{value, computed}` — captured from destructured parameter defaults (`{ variant = 'primary' }`) or JSDoc `@default`, code value wins on conflict |
| `parent.name` / `parent.fileName` | ✅ | `fileName` is always canonicalized to an absolute path regardless of how `--src` was invoked |
| `declarations` | ❌ not emitted in `--format rdt` | Only present in `--format canonical` (the raw internal shape); omitted from both `--format rdt` and `--format storybook` to match RDT's single-parent shape. File an issue if you need it |

### Intentionally omitted

| Prop | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `ref` | Not a user-facing prop — a React internal. RDT includes it because it walks the full inherited type; we treat it as noise |
| `key` | Same reasoning as `ref` |

### HTML attribute inheritance

RDT inlines every inherited HTML attribute (e.g. all ~250-300 members of `ButtonHTMLAttributes`) directly into `props`. This tool doesn't, by default — set `--html-attributes` to control it:

| Mode | Behavior | Reaches `--format rdt` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `curated` (default) | ~15-20 commonly-documented attributes per element (`onClick`, `disabled`, `type`, ARIA attrs) in `notableInherited`. `inheritance` (canonical format only) still records the full layer — element, `Omit`-ted keys. | No |
| `full` | Resolves `@types/react`'s real `HTMLAttributes`/`AriaAttributes`/`DOMAttributes`/`<Element>HTMLAttributes` chain and merges it directly into `props`, matching RDT's flat behavior. | Yes |
| `none` | Own-declared props only. | Yes (nothing to add) |

Flag by layer: `--html-attributes full` (CLI), `htmlAttributes: 'full'` (NAPI), `htmlAttributes: "full"` (`docgen.config.ts`).

**`full` mode accuracy:** verified against a real button, 238 of ~250 real attributes resolve. The remainder is a narrow gap — a handful of `@types/react` fields reference a same-namespace sibling type without an explicit qualifier, which degrades to an `UNRESOLVABLE_IMPORT` diagnostic on that one field rather than a crash or missing component. Details in `docs/rdt-coverage.md`'s "HtmlAttributeMode" section.

If you need the full attribute set and aren't ready to opt into `full` mode, this is the main compatibility gap to check for your specific components.

## Getting the exact diff for your codebase

`apps/validate/` is the harness used to compare this tool's output against a real `react-docgen-typescript` run, field by field, across 20 real component libraries (shadcn, MUI, Chakra, Mantine, React Aria, Radix, Fluent UI, Base UI, Ant Design, Ark UI, Zendesk Garden, React Day Picker, Headless UI, Blueprint, and others — full list in `docs/rdt-coverage.md`).

Don't just trust this document — run it against your own components:

```bash
pnpm --filter @oxc-react-docgen/validate compare:all
```

`docs/rdt-coverage.md` tracks which pattern each fixture exercises and the bugs found along the way (almost all now fixed).
