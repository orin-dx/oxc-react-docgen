# RDT Spec Coverage Matrix

Maps each react-docgen-typescript (RDT) output field and component pattern to the fixtures that exercise it.
Run `cargo test -p oxc-react-docgen-core --test snapshots` to validate the original 8 snapshot fixtures.
The 8 real-world library fixtures added since (fluentui, base-ui, antd, ark-ui, zendesk-garden, day-picker,
headlessui, blueprint) aren't snapshot-tested — validate them via `pnpm --filter @oxc-react-docgen/validate compare:all`.

## PropType kinds

Each `PropType` variant the resolver can emit; whether any fixture produces it.

| Kind | Covered by |
|------|-----------|
| `string` | all fixtures |
| `number` | all fixtures |
| `boolean` | all fixtures |
| `null` | mui, shadcn |
| `unknown` | mui |
| `reactNode` | chakra, mantine, mui, react-aria |
| `cssProperties` | chakra, mui, react-aria, shadcn |
| `elementType` | chakra, mantine, mui |
| `stringLiteral` | chakra, mantine, mui, react-aria, shadcn |
| `union` | chakra, mantine, mui, react-aria, shadcn, **day-picker** (7-way discriminated) |
| `named` | chakra, mantine, mui, react-aria |
| `eventHandler` | all fixtures; real param names from `(open: boolean) => void`-style handlers (not a hardcoded `"e"`) verified against **headlessui**, **ark-ui** |
| `ref` | mantine, mui |
| `object` | mantine, **rdt-compat/types** (`raw_string()` renders real fields — `{ key: Type; key2?: Type2 }` — not the literal placeholder `"object"`) |
| `literalUnion` | mantine, shadcn, **panda** (after defineRecipe arg-index fix) |
| `array` | **rdt-compat/types** (`string[]` syntax), **day-picker** (`readonly string[]` type-operator form) |
| `tuple` | **rdt-compat/types** (`[number, number]`; `raw_string()` renders real elements, not the placeholder `"tuple"`) |
| `numberLiteral` | **rdt-compat/types** (`1 \| 2 \| 4 \| 8`) |
| `boolLiteral` | **rdt-compat/types** (`true` literal type) |
| `undefined` | **rdt-compat/types** (explicit `?: undefined`) |
| `sxProps` | **rdt-compat/types** (unresolved `SxProps` ref → known-pattern shortcut) |
| `htmlAttributes` | **rdt-compat/types** (`ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'>` as prop value); real per-element attribute resolution (not just this metadata layer) — see [HtmlAttributeMode](#htmlattributemode-curated--full--none) below |
| `intersection` | **rdt-compat/types** (`CSSProperties & { '--accent': string }`) |
| `opaque` | **rdt-compat/types** (inline conditional type `T extends A ? B : C`) |
| `void` | ❌ not covered — `() => void` captured as `eventHandler`, standalone `void` never appears |
| `never` | ❌ not covered — no real-world prop has type `never` |
| `any` | ❌ not covered — `any` suppressed by TypeScript `strict` in fixtures |

> **Note on `void` / `never`:** These kinds exist in the type system for completeness but are not
> realistic prop types. A function return type `() => void` is always emitted as `eventHandler`,
> and `never` typically indicates a broken discriminant. No fixture is planned for either.

## ComponentEntry fields

| Field | Status | Covered by |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `displayName` | ✅ | all fixtures |
| `filePath` | ✅ | all fixtures |

| `description` (non-empty) | ✅ | mui, radix |
| `tags.default` | ✅ | mui, mantine |
| `tags.deprecated` | ✅ | mantine; correctly scoped to only the annotated prop, not bled onto siblings — **antd** (see [Fixed: JSDoc tag bleed](#fixed-jsdoc-tag-bleeding-onto-sibling-props)) |
| `tags.see` | ✅ | mui, mantine |
| `tags.example` | ✅ | mantine |
| `tags.since` | ✅ | **rdt-compat/jsdoc** (`@since` on `header` prop) |

| `declarations: []` | ✅ | shadcn |

---

|---------|--------|-----------|
| `React.forwardRef` | ✅ | shadcn, panda, mantine, react-aria |
| `React.forwardRef(...) as X` (trailing cast) | ✅ | **fluentui**, **ark-ui** — see [Fixed: forwardRef as-cast](#fixed-forwardref-wrapped-in-an-as-cast) |

| PandaCSS `defineSlotRecipe()` | ⚠️ | see [Note: slot recipes](#note-slot-recipes-partial-support) |
| Discriminated union (per-variant props) | ✅ | mui TextField, **day-picker** (7-way, double-discriminated) |
| Union-of-interfaces as root props type | ✅ | fixed — see [Fixed: union-of-interfaces](#fixed-union-of-interfaces-root-props-type-silently-skipped-the-component) |
| `asChild` slot pattern | ✅ | radix, shadcn, panda |
| Classic `as="button"` polymorphism (not `asChild`, not render-prop) | ✅ | **headlessui** |
| Intersection-based prop inheritance | ✅ | chakra, mantine, mui |
| `Omit<T, Keys>` on inherited props | ✅ | chakra, mantine, mui |
| Two `Partial<X>` mixins on one interface | ✅ | **blueprint** — see [Fixed: Partial\<X\> cycle-key collision](#fixed-partialx-cycle-detection-key-collision) |
| `Pick<SourceInterface, Keys>` | ✅ | fixed — see [Fixed: Pick not resolved](#fixed-pickt-keys-not-resolved-even-for-source-types) |
| User-defined generic type alias substitution (`type Assign<T,U> = Omit<T, keyof U> & U`) | ✅ | **ark-ui** — see [Fixed: generic type alias substitution](#fixed-user-defined-generic-type-alias-substitution) |
| Same-file TS `namespace X { type Props }` member reference | ✅ | **base-ui** — see [Fixed: namespace member resolution](#fixed-same-file-namespace-member-resolution) |
| Controlled/uncontrolled triple | ✅ | **rdt-compat/controlled** (value + defaultValue + onValueChange) |
| Method-shorthand handler (arrow form) | ✅ | **rdt-compat/controlled** (`onOpenChange?: (open: bool) => void` → correct `eventType`) |
| Method-shorthand handler (shorthand form) | ✅ | fixed — see [Fixed: method-shorthand](#fixed-method-shorthand-handler-losing-param-type) |

| JSDoc `@deprecated` on prop | ✅ | mantine, antd |
| JSDoc `@see` / `@example` on prop | ✅ | mui, mantine |

| Render-prop children | ✅ | react-aria (`ButtonRenderProps`) |
| HTML element inheritance, curated | ✅ | all fixtures |
| HTML element inheritance, full real resolution | ✅ | shadcn, **blueprint** — see [HtmlAttributeMode](#htmlattributemode-curated--full--none) |
| `styled.X.attrs<T>()` (styled-components) | ❌ | **zendesk-garden** — neither this tool nor real RDT detects this pattern; a shared blind spot, not a competitive gap, not fixed |
| Template literal type → opaque | ❌ | mantine has `"compact-${MantineSize}"` but it's not seen as `opaque` in snapshots — verify |
| HOC pattern | ✅ | extractor unit test only (no snapshot fixture) |
| Generic component | ⚠️ partial | own generic type ALIAS substitution works (**ark-ui**); React's own builtin generics resolve by name only, never by substituted value (sufficient for docgen — see `docs/type-checker-integration.md`); component-level `<T,>()=>` type-param flow through a multi-file component tree not covered |
| `defaultProps` static assignment | ❌ | no fixture |
| Class component | ❌ | out of scope (modern React only) |

## HtmlAttributeMode: curated / full / none

`PipelineOptions.html_attributes` (CLI: `--html-attributes <curated|full|none>`; NAPI: `htmlAttributes: 'curated' | 'full' | 'none'`;
config file: `htmlAttributes` in `docgen.config.ts`) controls how much of an inherited HTML element's attribute
surface gets exposed:

- **Curated (default)** — unchanged original behavior: ~15-20 hand-picked, commonly-documented attributes per
  element (`onClick`, `disabled`, `aria-*`, etc.) synthesized into `notableInherited`.
- **Full** — actually resolves `@types/react`'s real `HTMLAttributes`/`AriaAttributes`/`DOMAttributes`/
  `<Element>HTMLAttributes` interface chain (merged into `GlobalSourceData` by the pipeline, looked up by the
  resolver like any other interface) and merges the real fields directly into `props` — matching how RDT
  flattens everything into one props map. Verified against a real button: 238 of ~250 real attributes resolve
  (the remainder is a narrower, separate gap — see below). Costs ~16ms once per `@types/react` version (cached
  the same way any other `.d.ts` is), not per extraction run.
- **None** — no inherited HTML attributes synthesized at all; own props only.

**Known residual gap, not fixed:** a handful of fields inside `@types/react`'s own interface chain
(`AriaAttributes` referenced bare from within the same enclosing `declare namespace React {}` block, not
through an explicit `React.` qualifier) don't resolve — same-namespace *sibling* reference resolution is
narrower than the namespace-*qualified* reference resolution fixed for cross-file/explicit cases. Degrades
gracefully (an `UNRESOLVABLE_IMPORT` diagnostic on that one field, not a crash or component loss).

---

## Fixed bugs (previously tracked here as open)

### Fixed: method-shorthand handler losing param type

**Fixture:** `fixtures/rdt-compat/controlled.tsx`

Previously: `onValueChange?(value: string): void` (TSMethodSignature form) emitted `eventType: "..."` instead of
`eventType: "string"`, while the arrow-function form correctly emitted `eventType: "boolean"`. Root cause: the
extractor's method-signature handling didn't extract parameter types the same way as property-signature
handling. Fixed — confirmed live: `onValueChange` now correctly resolves to `(value: string) => void`.

---

### Fixed: `Pick<T, Keys>` not resolved even for source types

**Fixture:** `fixtures/rdt-compat/pick-source.tsx`

Previously: `interface IconButtonProps extends Pick<ButtonBaseProps, 'disabled' | 'type' | 'form'>` lost the
picked props entirely — only `icon`/`label` (the interface's own props) appeared. Fixed — confirmed live:
`IconButton` now correctly includes `disabled`, `form`, `type` alongside `icon`/`label`.

---

### Fixed: union-of-interfaces root props type silently skipped the component

**Fixture:** `fixtures/rdt-compat/discriminated-union.tsx`

Previously: `Accordion` with props type `AccordionSingleProps | AccordionMultipleProps` was completely absent
from the output, no diagnostic. Fixed — confirmed live: `Accordion` now resolves with all 5 real props.

---

### Fixed: component description set to last prop's JSDoc

**Fixtures:** `fixtures/rdt-compat/controlled.tsx`, `pick-source.tsx`, `memo.tsx`

Previously: when a component had no JSDoc of its own, `ComponentEntry.description` picked up the last prop's
JSDoc instead of staying empty (the extractor's proximity-based `find_jsdoc` scan finding the wrong nearest
comment). Fixed — confirmed live: `Select`/`IconButton`/`Avatar` all correctly show `description: ""`.

---

### Fixed: forwardRef wrapped in an `as`-cast

**Fixtures:** `fixtures/fluentui/Button.tsx`, `fixtures/ark-ui/Select.tsx`

Fluent UI's real Button (and Ark UI's real Select) are authored as
`const X: SomeWrapper<Props> = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {...}) as SomeWrapper<Props>` — neither
`try_fc_annotation` (the wrapper type name wasn't recognized) nor `try_forward_ref`/`try_hoc_wrapped` (both
required the initializer to be a `CallExpression` directly, not a `TSAsExpression` wrapping one) detected this;
the component was silently invisible. Fixed by recognizing `ForwardRefComponent<P>` as a wrapper annotation and
peeling `as`-casts before matching the call expression underneath. Confirmed: Fluent's Button 0 → 8 props.

---

### Fixed: same-file namespace member resolution

**Fixture:** `fixtures/base-ui/MenuRoot.tsx`, `MenuTrigger.tsx`

Base UI's real pattern is `namespace MenuRoot { export type Props<Payload> = ... }`, referenced elsewhere in
the same file as `MenuRoot.Props`. Storage keyed on the bare member name while the resolver looked up the
fully-qualified dotted name — same-file namespace member references could never resolve. Fixed by tracking an
enclosing-namespace stack during extraction and qualifying storage keys to match. Confirmed:
MenuRoot 0 → 15 props (exact match with real RDT), MenuTrigger invisible → 11 props.

---

### Fixed: JSDoc `@tag` bleeding onto sibling props

**Fixture:** `fixtures/antd/Button.tsx`

`find_jsdoc` (description) tracked consumed comment spans so two elements never share one description;
`extract_jsdoc_tags` (the `@tag` map) ran a separate scan with no consumed-tracking at all, so a `@deprecated`
tag correctly claimed by one prop was still "found" and inherited by a later sibling with no JSDoc of its own.
Fixed by merging both lookups into one consuming pass. Confirmed: only `iconPosition` carries `@deprecated`
now, not `iconPlacement`/`shape`/`size`/`disabled`.

---

### Fixed: user-defined generic type alias substitution

**Fixture:** `fixtures/ark-ui/Select.tsx`

`type Assign<T, U> = Omit<T, keyof U> & U` used with concrete call-site arguments (Ark UI's real
`SelectRootProps<T> = Assign<HTMLProps<'div'>, SelectRootBaseProps<T>>`) never substituted `T`/`U` — type alias
declarations didn't record their own declared parameters, and call-site type arguments were computed but
discarded before alias resolution ran. `Omit<T, keyof U>`'s `keyof U` was also silently treated as an empty key
list. Fixed via a structural walk-and-replace substitution engine (no type inference — real field names for
`keyof U` come from resolving `U` as its own props chain). Confirmed: SelectRoot 0 → 36 real props via the
actual, unmodified upstream pattern.

---

### Fixed: `Partial<X>` cycle-detection key collision

**Fixture:** `fixtures/blueprint/Table.tsx`

`TableProps extends Partial<RowHeights>, Partial<ColumnWidths>` — the resolver's cycle-detection visited-key
was built from the bare type name alone (`"Partial"`), not its type arguments, so the second `Partial<X>`
extends target collided with the first's cycle-guard entry and silently resolved to nothing, with zero
diagnostic. Fixed by folding type arguments into the key. Confirmed: Table 45 → 48 props, exact match with real
RDT.

---

### Fixed: discriminated unions wrapped in an intersection

**Fixture:** `fixtures/day-picker/DayPicker.tsx`

Discriminant detection only ran when a type alias's RHS was *directly* a union (`type X = A | B`). Real Day
Picker's `DayPickerProps = PropsBase & (7-way union)` — an intersection whose union member fell into a naive
per-member merge instead, keeping only whichever branch's type was seen first per prop instead of unioning
across all branches. Fixed by having the intersection-nested-union case delegate to the same discriminant-merge
logic a direct union alias uses. Confirmed: `selected`'s type now correctly merges `Date | Date[] | DateRange`
across all 7 branches (previously collapsed to bare `Date`). Also confirmed (and this is *correct*, not a
remaining bug): `discriminantProp` stays `null` for Day Picker's real union, because `mode` repeats the same
value across `PropsSingle`/`PropsSingleRequired` — it's only jointly unique with a second field (`required`),
so no single field actually identifies the variant.

---

### Fixed: bare function-type alias silently dropped

**Fixture:** `fixtures/day-picker/props.ts`

`type OnSelectHandler<T> = (selected: T, ...) => void` — a bare function type as an alias body — fell through
`classify_type_alias`'s catch-all and vanished from `type_aliases` with no diagnostic, same failure mode as the
already-fixed inline-object-literal case. Fixed by routing `TSFunctionType` through the same `Passthrough`
wrapping `TSTypeLiteral` already used. Confirmed: `OnSelectHandler` no longer triggers a "cannot resolve"
warning.

---

### Fixed: identifier-wrapped components renamed to export binding

**Fixture:** `fixtures/headlessui/Listbox.tsx`

Headless UI's real Listbox family: standalone top-level function declarations (`function ButtonFn(props, ref)`)
wrapped by a library-defined `forwardRefWithAs` (not React's own `forwardRef`) and reassigned
(`export let ListboxButton = forwardRefWithAs(ButtonFn) as X`). `ButtonFn` was already independently detected
as its own component (a valid top-level PascalCase function with a typed first param) under the wrong,
inner-implementation-only name — neither `try_forward_ref` (the callee isn't `React.forwardRef`) nor
`try_hoc_wrapped` (the argument is a bare identifier, not an inline function) recognized the wrapping
assignment. Fixed the same way the existing `displayName`-scan already handles a similar after-the-fact rename:
when a variable's initializer is (after unwrapping any `as` cast) a call whose sole argument is a bare
identifier matching an already-collected component, rename that mapping to the outer binding. Confirmed: all
three components (`Listbox`, `ListboxButton`, `ListboxOption`) now report their real export names, matching
real RDT.

---

### Fixed: type alias union/intersection members resolved relative to the wrong file

**Fixture:** `fixtures/tanstack-table/types.ts`

`ColumnDef<TData, TValue> = DisplayColumnDef<...> | GroupColumnDef<...> | AccessorColumnDef<...>` — a union whose
members are same-file siblings of the alias, imported cross-file into `data-table.tsx` as just `ColumnDef`.
`resolve_type_alias_type` forwarded the *caller's* `consuming_file` into the recursive member resolution instead
of the alias's own declaring file, so `DisplayColumnDef` etc. were looked up relative to `data-table.tsx` (which
never imports them directly) and spuriously flagged as unresolvable, even though the actual `PropType::Named`
output was already correct. Fixed by giving `CollectedTypeAlias` a `file_path()` accessor and using it instead of
the passed-in file for every recursive call.

### Fixed: generic interface/alias's own type parameters flagged as unresolvable

**Fixture:** `fixtures/tanstack-table/data-table.tsx`

`DataTableProps<TData, TValue>` referencing its own `TData`/`TValue` in its body (`columns: ColumnDef<TData,
TValue>[]`) had every such reference warned as "cannot resolve — will appear as opaque", even though a bare
generic placeholder is the objectively correct, expected output. The resolver had no concept of a type's own
declared parameters. Added `interface_type_params` (mirroring the existing `type_alias_params`) and a
`ResolveState.in_scope_type_params` set populated when entering a generic interface/alias body;
`resolve_named` checks it before warning. 234 → 173 diagnostics across all fixtures.

### Fixed: named type-only imports from `react` resolved to the wrong file/key

**Fixture:** `fixtures/react-resizable-panels/types.ts`

`import type { X } from "react"` (any `X` not special-cased via `html_element_for`) failed for two independent
reasons: (1) `react`'s own `package.json` has no `"types"` field/condition — its real declarations live in the
separate `@types/react` package — so the general import resolver landed on `index.js`; (2) `@types/react`
declares everything inside `declare namespace React { ... }`, so even the right file's declarations are keyed
`"React.X"`, not bare `"X"`. Fixed resolver-wide: `resolve_import_specifier` now tries `resolve_dts` + the
`@types/<package>` fallback for bare specifiers (reusing the logic already proven for `HtmlAttributeMode::Full`),
and new `lookup_interface`/`lookup_type_alias` helpers try the bare key before the `React.`-qualified one,
replacing direct map lookups at every interface/alias resolution site.

### Fixed: indexed access into a generic interface's own field

**Fixture:** `fixtures/react-final-form/types.ts`

`RenderableProps<FieldRenderProps<FieldValue, T>>["children"]` (the real "children as a render-function-or-
ReactNode union" pattern) degraded to `Opaque` — `resolve_indexed_access`'s only fallback resolved the object
type and checked for `PropType::Object`, but an interface always resolves to a bare `PropType::Named` at the
type level (never expanded there), so it never matched. Added a path that looks the field up directly on the
interface's declaration and substitutes its declared type parameters with the caller's concrete arguments,
reusing the existing generic-alias substitution machinery. Both indexed-access fields in this fixture
(`children`, `component`) now resolve to real structured types with the correct substituted argument threaded
through, zero diagnostics.

### Fixed: type aliases silently dropped for any unhandled body shape

**Fixture:** `fixtures/storybook-emotion/Button.tsx`

`type API_KeyCollection = string[]` — found while investigating the fixture below. `classify_type_alias`'s
catch-all was `_ => None`: any alias body shape without a dedicated match arm vanished from `type_aliases`
entirely, no diagnostic, same failure mode already fixed twice this session for `TSTypeLiteral` and
`TSFunctionType` individually. Generalized the catch-all itself to `Passthrough`-wrap whatever
`ts_type_to_collected` already produces, rather than adding a third narrow special case. 171 → 153 diagnostics
across all fixtures (curated), 224 → 206 (full) — fixed the same silent-drop in other fixtures too, not just
this one.

`defineSlotRecipe` (PandaCSS) and `tv({ slots })` (tailwind-variants) are in the recognized callee list and benefit from the 2026-06-28 arg-index fix. However, slot recipe variant values are objects (`{ root: "class", header: "class" }`) rather than plain strings. The current `try_collect_cva_call` variant value extraction reads only string values, so slot recipe variants will have 0 entries in `global.enums` even after the arg-index fix.

The `RecipeVariantProps<typeof slotRecipe>` reference will fall back to opaque output with `raw: "VariantProps<typeof slotRecipe>"` in the `composes` array. This is documented as a limitation, not a bug.

**To support slot recipes:** extend the variant value extractor to accept both `string` and `ObjectExpression` values, treating the object's string values as the display representation.
