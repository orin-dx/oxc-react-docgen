# Pipeline orchestration

**Source:** `crates/core/src/pipeline/mod.rs`, `crates/core/src/pipeline/discover.rs`, `crates/core/src/pipeline/watch.rs`, `crates/core/src/cache.rs`, `crates/core/src/import_map.rs`, `crates/core/src/panic_guard.rs`, `crates/core/src/plugin.rs`

This is the orchestration layer: it owns nothing about *how* a component is parsed or resolved (that's `extractor/` and `resolver/`), only *when* and *in what order* files get discovered, parsed, merged, and resolved, and how failures at any step degrade instead of propagating.

## The 6-phase data flow

`extract_with_global()` (`pipeline/mod.rs:223`) is the single implementation shared by both `extract()` (cold, one-shot) and `WatchSession::initialize()` (the first run inside a watch session). Every phase below runs exactly once per call:

- **Phase 0 — validate.** Checks `options.src_dirs` isn't empty and that at least one entry exists on disk. Sequential, trivial cost. Exists specifically so a typo'd `--src` produces an `Error` diagnostic instead of a silent zero-component, zero-diagnostic run (CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #6).
- **Phase 1 — discover.** `discover_files()` walks `src_dirs` via the `ignore` crate, filters to `.ts`/`.tsx`, applies built-in and user excludes, canonicalizes each path, then sorts and dedups. Sequential — it's I/O-bound directory walking, not CPU work worth parallelizing, and the final sort is required for the determinism invariant below.
- **Phase 2 — parse (parallel).** `src_files.par_iter().map(...)` via rayon. Each file either hits the `.d.ts` cache or gets parsed fresh by `extractor::parse_file`. This is the phase worth parallelizing: OXC parsing is pure CPU work, one file is fully independent of another, and this is typically the dominant cost of a run. Every closure body is wrapped in `panic_guard::contain_panic`.
- **Phase 3 — merge (+3.5/3.6), sequential.** Each file's `SourceData` (plus any plugin `on_file_extracted` mutation) is folded into one `GlobalSourceData` via hash-map insertions. This phase is sequential specifically because it's cheap (hash-map inserts, not real work) and because `GlobalSourceData` is a single shared structure being built incrementally — parallelizing it would require synchronization that costs more than the merge itself. Phase 3.5 (Full HTML-attribute mode) and Phase 3.6 (ambient TS lib files) extend the same merge with `@types/react` and `lib.es5.d.ts`/`lib.dom.d.ts`, both going through `merge_cached_dts_file` so their diagnostics aren't dropped (see Invariant 3).
- **Phase 4 — resolve (parallel).** `mappings.par_iter().map(|m| resolve_component(m, &ctx))`, again via rayon, again each closure wrapped in `contain_panic`. `ResolutionContext` wraps `Arc<GlobalSourceData>` so every thread reads the same immutable snapshot; per this crate's `CLAUDE.md`, all resolver inputs must be owned or `Arc`-wrapped since rayon may run this on any thread.
- **Phase 5 — collect/dedup/serialize.** Sequential fold of `(ComponentEntry, Vec<Diagnostic>)` pairs into the output `BTreeMap`, running the display-name collision/disambiguation logic (Invariant 1) and each plugin's `on_component_resolved` hook, then persisting the DTS cache and building `ExtractionStats`.

**Why parallel exactly at phases 2 and 4, nowhere else:** those are the only two phases doing embarrassingly-parallel, side-effect-free-per-item CPU work over an already-known-size collection. Discovery is I/O-walk-bound: merge and collect both build one shared structure incrementally, which is cheaper done sequentially than synchronized.

## Watch mode's incremental model

`WatchSession` (`pipeline/watch.rs`) keeps `global` (`ArcSwap<GlobalSourceData>`), `reverse_deps` (`ArcSwap<ReverseDeps>`), a per-file `source_cache: DashMap`, and `component_cache: DashMap<String, ComponentEntry>` alive across many `update_file()` calls. `initialize()` runs one full cold `extract_with_global(options, true)` — the `true` means "also hand back each file's own `SourceData`" so the session can seed `source_cache` without a second parse pass. `initialize()` is idempotent under a `Mutex<bool>` guard, with `.unwrap_or_else(|p| p.into_inner())` recovering from a poisoned lock rather than propagating a second panic (ADR 0005, "defense in depth").

`update_file(changed)` does *not* rerun the 6-phase pipeline. It:
1. Re-parses only `changed`.
2. Patches `global` via `ArcSwap::rcu` (read-copy-update) — `remove_file` then `merge`, retried automatically if another `update_file` call raced the swap.
3. Looks up `reverse_deps.affected(changed)` — a BFS over the reverse import graph — to find every file transitively affected by this one change.
4. Re-resolves only the `ComponentMapping`s belonging to affected files, in parallel, against the freshly-swapped `global`.
5. Replaces (not appends) this file's diagnostics in a `DashMap<Utf8PathBuf, Vec<Diagnostic>>`, so a since-fixed error doesn't linger in `snapshot()` forever.

`ReverseDeps` is built once at `initialize()` time from `global.import_map`, by string-appending each relative import specifier onto its consuming file's parent directory and probing `.ts`/`.tsx`/`/index.ts`/`/index.tsx` suffixes with no filesystem I/O (an approximation, not a real resolve). **It is never rebuilt within a session** — see Known Gaps below.

## Key types (verbatim)

```rust
pub struct ReverseDeps {
    pub(super) inner: FxHashMap<Utf8PathBuf, Vec<Utf8PathBuf>>,
}
```

```rust
pub struct WatchSession {
    pub options: PipelineOptions,
    pub global: ArcSwap<GlobalSourceData>,
    pub reverse_deps: ArcSwap<ReverseDeps>,
    pub source_cache: DashMap<Utf8PathBuf, SourceData>,
    pub component_cache: DashMap<String, ComponentEntry>,
    pub diagnostics: DashMap<Utf8PathBuf, Vec<Diagnostic>>,
    ambient_global_files: std::sync::OnceLock<Vec<Utf8PathBuf>>,
    initialized: Mutex<bool>,
}
```

```rust
pub fn contain_panic<T>(label: &str, f: impl FnOnce() -> T) -> Result<T, Diagnostic>
```

```rust
pub trait DocgenPlugin: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn on_file_extracted(&self, _file_path: &camino::Utf8Path, _data: &mut SourceData) {}
    fn on_component_resolved(&self, _entry: &mut ComponentEntry) {}
}
```

## Invariants

1. **Component output keys are `display_name`, disambiguated to `"{name} ({file_path})"` on the 2nd+ occurrence of that name — this still collides for a genuine 3-way-or-more same-name-same-file duplicate.** Phase 5 tracks a `seen_names: HashMap<String, u32>` counter per base name; the *first* occurrence gets the bare name, every later occurrence gets the disambiguated key. Since `file_path` is unique per file, two different libraries shipping a same-named `Button.tsx` never collide (each gets a distinct disambiguated key) — but three or more literal duplicate declarations of the same component in the *same file* (`function Button() {}` repeated) all key identically after the first, and `components.insert` silently overwrites unless its `Option<ComponentEntry>` return is checked. It is checked (see `pipeline/mod.rs:456`), which is what turns this residual case into a `ComponentKeyCollision` diagnostic rather than a silent drop — but the entry itself is still lost from the map, only the *fact* of the loss is preserved. See `test_duplicate_component_declarations_in_one_file_emit_a_collision_diagnostic`.

2. **`discover_files` must dedup identical canonical paths *before* they become separate `ComponentMapping`s — the Phase-5 collision check alone cannot catch a 2-directory overlap.** Two overlapping `src_dirs` (e.g. `["./src", "./src/components"]`) walk the same physical file twice. Because the two resulting mappings key *differently* under Invariant 1's numbering scheme (first occurrence → bare name, second → disambiguated name), they never collide at `insert` and would both silently appear as separate output entries. The actual fix is the `files.sort(); files.dedup();` at the end of `discover_files` (`discover.rs:94-95`), which only works because every path was canonicalized first — an uncanonicalized relative/absolute duplicate pair would sort non-adjacently and evade `dedup()`. See `test_overlapping_src_dirs_two_directories_deduplicates_without_a_duplicate_listing`.

3. **Every `.d.ts` merge into `GlobalSourceData` — main-loop, Full-mode `@types/react`, and ambient lib.d.ts — must drain the parsed file's own diagnostics before merging, because `GlobalSourceData` itself has no diagnostics field to catch them later.** Phase 3.5/3.6 route through the shared `merge_cached_dts_file` helper specifically to guarantee this; calling `global.merge()` directly on freshly-parsed data (as Phase 3.5/3.6 originally did) silently drops any excessive-nesting or parse-error diagnostic the extractor raised while parsing that file. See `merge_cached_dts_file_does_not_drop_parse_diagnostics`.

4. **Discovery output is deterministic across OS/filesystem: sorted, deduplicated, and canonicalized.** This is load-bearing for two independent reasons: diagnostic ordering and dedup-winner-selection in Phase 5 are reproducible only because rayon's `.collect()` on a `par_iter()` preserves input order and the sequential merge/resolve phases iterate that same order; and `parent.fileName` in resolver output would otherwise differ depending on whether `--src` was given relative or absolute, or what the invocation cwd was.

5. **`ReverseDeps` is built once, at `WatchSession::initialize()`, from a fully-merged `GlobalSourceData` — never partially, never mid-session.** `ReverseDeps::build` needs `global.import_map` to already reflect Phase 3.5/3.6's merges (ambient globals, `@types/react`) to be complete; building it from a hand-rolled partial `GlobalSourceData` (a bug this code carried previously — see the doc comment on `extract_with_global`) silently produced an incomplete reverse graph that `update_file`'s BFS then propagated changes through incorrectly.

6. **A cache-persistence failure (`DtsCache::save_to_disk`) must degrade to `DiagnosticSeverity::Info`, never `Warning`.** `Warning` would flip `docgen check --strict`'s exit code to 1 purely because the *next* run will have to re-parse `.d.ts` files — extraction output for *this* run is completely correct either way. This is a deliberate severity choice, not an oversight; the comment at `cache.rs:143-148` explicitly calls out this is the same class of spurious exit-code flip already fixed once elsewhere in the resolver.

7. **Anything reachable from a rayon `.map()` closure or a `DocgenPlugin` hook call must be wrapped in `panic_guard::contain_panic`, individually, per item — not once around the whole batch.** The `.map()` closures at Phase 2 and Phase 4 wrap their *entire bodies*; `PluginRegistry::run_on_file_extracted`/`run_on_component_resolved` wrap *each individual plugin call*, not the surrounding loop, so one misbehaving plugin degrades only itself and every other registered plugin still runs (see `a_panicking_plugin_is_contained_and_tagged_with_its_name_others_still_run`). Violating the per-item granularity (e.g. wrapping the whole `.collect()` instead of each closure invocation) reintroduces the exact failure mode ADR 0005 was written to close: one bad file/plugin/component poisons the whole batch.

8. **`update_file`'s `changed` path must be canonicalized the same way `discover_files` canonicalizes at cold-start, or the reverse-dependency lookup silently finds nothing.** `discover_files` resolves symlinks via the `ignore` walker (e.g. macOS's `/var` → `/private/var`), so every key already stored in `global`/`reverse_deps` is in that resolved form. A raw file-watcher-reported path that skips `canonicalize_best_effort` looks up the wrong key in `reverse_deps.affected()` and returns an empty affected-set with no error at all — not a crash, a silent under-update.

## Locked design decisions

- **Two rayon parallel phases, everything else sequential.** Already covered above under "the 6-phase data flow" — restated here because it's the decision most likely to look "obviously improvable" by parallelizing merge/collect too. Don't: both are cheap relative to parse/resolve, and both build one shared mutable structure whose synchronization cost would exceed the sequential cost.
- **DTS cache keys on `(path, size, mtime_ns)`, not a content hash.** A cheap stat-only check is the entire point of this cache's speed advantage; a content hash closes the residual staleness gap (Known Gaps below) but was deliberately rejected as disproportionate to the problem's real frequency — see `cache.rs:196-204`'s doc comment and `docs/root-cause-analysis.md` line 140, which additionally notes that *if* this is ever revisited, a fast non-cryptographic hash (xxhash/CRC) over bytes already being read for size would be the right scope, not a full cryptographic hash.
- **`contain_panic` uses `AssertUnwindSafe` internally, not at call sites.** Plugin hooks pass `&mut SourceData`/`&mut ComponentEntry`, and `&mut T` is unconditionally `!UnwindSafe` in std — requiring callers to prove unwind-safety themselves would make every call site either not compile or need its own `AssertUnwindSafe`. The justification is structural, not incidental: `SourceData`/`ComponentEntry` have no interior mutability (`Cell`/`RefCell`), so a caught panic mid-operation can't leave an observably-torn half-write behind — the whole operation's output is simply discarded. See ADR 0005 and `panic_guard.rs:14-19`.
- **`ComponentMapping`/`GlobalSourceData` construction happens once per cold run and is reused, immutable, across all of Phase 4's parallel resolve closures via `Arc`.** `ResolutionContext::new(global.clone(), options)` wraps the `Arc<GlobalSourceData>` once outside the `par_iter()`, not per-item — this is the mechanism that makes "all resolver inputs must be owned or `Arc`-wrapped" (crates/core/CLAUDE.md) actually cheap rather than merely correct.
- **Plugin hooks are two narrow extension points (`on_file_extracted`, `on_component_resolved`), not a general AST-transform API.** Deliberately modeled after `michi`'s zero-dep trait pattern and `callisto`'s modular design (see `plugin.rs`'s module doc) — the hook surface is intentionally small so panic-containment and ordering guarantees stay easy to reason about per plugin.

## Known gaps

Cross-referencing `docs/edge-cases.md` and `docs/root-cause-analysis.md` for pipeline-specific findings — fixed vs. still open:

**Fixed** (all have regression tests in `pipeline/mod.rs`'s test module):
- Permission-denied subtrees and non-UTF8 filenames silently dropped during discovery — now surfaced as `IoError` diagnostics (`discover.rs`).
- Empty `src_dirs` bypassing the "missing dirs" diagnostic due to a `!is_empty()` boolean-logic bug — now its own distinct diagnostic message.
- Component-key collisions and overlapping-`src_dirs` duplication — see Invariants 1 and 2.
- No panic-containment anywhere in the repo — closed by ADR 0005 / `panic_guard.rs`, covering rayon closures, plugin hooks, and (per the ADR) NAPI entry points.
- `WatchSession::initialize()` previously hand-rebuilt `GlobalSourceData`, skipping Phase 3.5/3.6 merges — fixed by routing through the same `extract_with_global` the cold path uses (see Invariant 5 and the doc comment at `pipeline/mod.rs:212-222`).
- Phase 3.5/3.6 dropping parse diagnostics on direct `global.merge()` calls — see Invariant 3.

**Still open** (deliberately deferred, not oversights):
- **DTS cache mtime+size staleness on coarse-resolution filesystems** (`docs/edge-cases.md` P0-2, `docs/root-cause-analysis.md` line 140). An edit landing in the same tick as a prior write *and* producing an identical file length is served a stale cache hit. Scoped to `.d.ts` files only; not recommended for immediate action per the root-cause doc — see the Locked Design Decisions entry above for what a future fix should look like if ever revisited.
- **`ReverseDeps` is not incrementally updated within a watch session.** Only structural changes (a new `WatchSession`, i.e. restarting) rebuild it; adding or removing an import inside an existing file during a session leaves the reverse graph stale for that edge until the session restarts. This is stated directly in the `WatchSession` doc comment (`watch.rs:41-46`) as a known limitation, not derived from the edge-cases audit.
- **`watch --out` write failures are silently discarded** and writes are non-atomic (`docs/edge-cases.md` line 72-73; `docs/root-cause-analysis.md` line 139). This is CLI-layer (`cli/commands/watch.rs`), outside this subsystem's scope (`crates/core` non-negotiable #6 doesn't reach the CLI), but it directly affects how trustworthy `WatchSession`'s output is once it leaves this module.
- **LSP `Content-Length` header has no upper bound before allocation** (`docs/edge-cases.md` P1-2) — CLI-layer (`cli/commands/lsp.rs`), noted here only because it's adjacent to watch-mode's session lifecycle, not because it's part of this subsystem.
